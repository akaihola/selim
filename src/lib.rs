/// # Example
///
/// |                        111
/// |        time: 0123456789012

/// |  live notes:   C D   E   F  // actual played notes
/// |  live index:   0 1   2   3

/// * prev_match_live_index - For the last previously matched note, this gives the index
///                           of the event in the live performance
