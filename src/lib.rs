///
/// * score - The complete expected musical score with timestamps and pitches

/// * prev_match_score_index - For the last previously matched note between the live
///                            performance and the expected score, this gives the index
///                            of the event in the expected score
/// * prev_match_live_index - For the last previously matched note, this gives the index
///                           of the event in the live performance
/// * new_live_index - Index of the first new note received for the live performance
